                        <p>In the remote Irish woods, Cellach (Brendan Gleeson) prepares a fortress for an impending attack by a
                            Viking war party. Unbeknown to Cellach, his young nephew Brendan (Evan McGuire) — who has no taste
                            for battle — works secretly as an apprentice in the scriptorium of the local monastery, learning the
                            ancient art of calligraphy. As the Vikings approach, revered illuminator Aidan (Mick Lally) arrives at the monastery and recruits Brendan to complete a series of dangerous, magical tasks.</p>

                <p>Set in 9th century Ireland, during the age of Viking expansion, the film’s protagonist is Brendan, a
                    curious and brave boy living in the tightly knit Abbey of Kells under the care of his stern uncle,
                    Abbot Cellach, who is obsessed with building a wall around the Abbey to prevent Viking
                    attacks.Apprenticed in the scriptorium of the monastery, Brendan hears the other monks talk of
                    Brother Aidan, creator of the Book of Iona, and becomes curious about the mysterious illuminator and
                    the book that "turns darkness into light" (the unfinished Book of Kells). Aidan arrives in Kells,
                    accompanied by his white cat, Pangur Bán, after his monastery at Iona is destroyed by a raid. After
                    eavesdropping on a discussion between Cellach and Aidan, Brendan wanders into the scriptorium and
                    finds the still-to-be-completed book guarded by Pangur Bán. </p>

                <p>Seeing Brendan as a suitable apprentice, Aidan sends him and Pangur Bán into the woods to obtain gall
                    nuts to make ink. Cornered by a hungry pack of wolves, Brendan is saved by the fairy Aisling, who
                    overcomes her initial suspicion and accepts Brendan after he reveals his intentions of helping to
                    create the book.</p>

                <p>Pangur Bán and Brendan are close friends. At first, Pangur Bán was quite dismissive of Brendan, and
                    reacted hostilely when he tried to look at the Book of Iona. However, he managed to convince her of
                    his good intentions, and from that point on, she was a near-constant companion of his. Pangur Bán
                    called on the aid of the fairy to help Brendan escape from the high tower when Abbot Cellach locked
                    him, and Pangur Bán didn't hesitate when Aisling used her magic to turn the cat into a spirit to
                    release their mutual friend. Pangur Bán and Aisling are also friends. Aisling didn't have to do
                    anything to gain Pangur Ban's trust.</p>

                    ornate swirling motifs typical of Insular art. Figures of humans, animals and mythical beasts,

                <p>The Book of Kells remained in Kells until 1654. In that year, Cromwell's cavalry was quartered in the
                    church at Kells, and the governor of the town sent the book to Dublin for safekeeping. Henry Jones
                    presented the manuscript to Trinity College in Dublin in 1661.
